/**
 * Paths fast-redact will scrub before pino serializes a log object.
 * Two categories:
 *
 *   1. Credentials — Authorization, cookies, OAuth secrets, JWT
 *      assertions, hashed passwords. Never want these in logs.
 *   2. PHI carriers — request bodies, FHIR DocumentReference content,
 *      OperationOutcome diagnostics, raw upstream error bodies. A
 *      note's clinical text or a patient name showing up in a log
 *      drop is the kind of leak HIPAA audits flag.
 *
 * Keep this list defensive. Adding an over-redacted path costs a "[redacted]"
 * placeholder in dev logs; under-redacting costs an incident.
 *
 * Path syntax is fast-redact's: dotted paths, single-level `*`
 * wildcards, and `[]` indexing.
